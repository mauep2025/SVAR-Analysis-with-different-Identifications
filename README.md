alternative_identification.m        ---> Based on the sing set of Kilian & Daniel (2012), the code compares the SVAR results from a Cholesky Decomposition Identification vs a Sign-Restriction

External_instrument_identification.m ---> Following Kanzig (2019) and based on the code by Montiel Olea, Stock and Watson (2020), this estimate a Proxy-SVAR (i.e. identification with external instruments and high frecuency identification) and compares the results with different sets of instruments.
